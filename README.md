 **Overview**
This project uses a hybrid machine learning approach to detect, correlate, and mitigate cyberattacks in power distribution systems. It combines multiple ML models to improve smart grid security.

**Features**
Detects various types of cyberattacks

Correlates events to identify coordinated attacks

Suggests basic mitigation actions

Simple and modular design

 **Technologies**
Python

Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

** ML Models** 
Random Forest

SVM

XGBoost

Isolation Forest (for anomaly detection)

**Dataset**
Uses [Insert Dataset Name, e.g., NSL-KDD or custom simulated dataset].
